# 8hrBackupTimer
this application is meant to track hours worked for the week.  it also is used to circumvent the IT global setting which 
causes my PC to lock after an unreasonably short amount of time.  It does this by programatically pressing the CAPS LOCK
button twice to keep the screen from locking.

It uses the registry to add up the daily and weekly minutes, but has a bug that I intend to fix soon which causes a crash.
There is currently a bug in the calculation of minutes.
